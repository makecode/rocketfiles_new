        <h1>Legal Information</h1>
        <p class="information__text">Legal information retrieval is the science of <a href="#" class="information__link">information retrieval</a> applied to legal text, including legislation, case law, and scholarly works. Accurate legal information retrieval is important to provide access to the law to laymen and legal professionals. Its importance has increased because of the vast and quickly increasing amount of legal documents available through electronic means. Legal information retrieval is a part of the growing field of legal informatics.</p>
        <span class="information__title is-fz-22">Overview</span>
        <p class="information__text i-mb-22">In a legal setting, it is frequently important to retrieve all information related to a specific query. However, commonly used boolean search methods (exact matches of specified terms) on full text legal documents have been shown to have an average recall rate as low as 20 percent, meaning that only 1 in 5 relevant documents are actually retrieved. In that case, researchers believed that they had retrieved over 75% of relevant documents. This may result in failing to retrieve important or precedential cases. In some jurisdictions this may be especially problematic, as legal professionals are ethically obligated to be reasonably informed as to relevant legal documents.</p>
        <p class="information__text i-mb-22">Legal Information Retrieval attempts to increase the effectiveness of legal searches by increasing the number of relevant documents (providing a high recall rate) and reducing the number of irrelevant documents (a high precision rate). This is a difficult task, as the legal field is prone to jargon, polysemes (words that have different meanings when used in a legal context), and constant change.</p>
        <span class="information__title">A great optimization kit</span>
        <p class="information__text i-mb-22">The application's usability does not end here, because more tools are available under the homonimous tab. An integrated uninstaller lets you safely remove applications so that they leave no traces, startup items can also be deleted, as well as browser add-ons or extensions and even context menu processes. For example, in the context of European Union legislation, the term "worker" has four different meanings:</p>
        <ul class="list is-mark">
          <li class="list__el">Any worker as defined in Article 3(a) of Directive 89/391/EEC who habitually uses display screen equipment as a significant part of his normal work;</li>
          <li class="list__el">any person employed by an employer, including trainees and apprentices but excluding domestic servants;</li>
          <li class="list__el">any person carrying out an occupation on board a vessel, including trainees and apprentices, but excluding port pilots and shore personnel carrying out work on board a  vessel at the quayside;</li>
          <li class="list__el">any person who, in the Member State concerned, is protected as an employee under national employment law and in accordance with national practice.</li>
        </ul>
